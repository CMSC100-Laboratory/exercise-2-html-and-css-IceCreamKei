**How the GitHub page was created:**
  - create new file
  - name file "index.html"
  - move file to the given repository and commit
  - go to repository settings, then pages, then set source to the main branch

**Main takeaways:**
  - Graphic design is my prison
  - HTML and CSS is easy to understand but is difficult to utilize due to its nature as a markdown language
  - Having a good code editor helps speed up the process
  - Web programming should be a gradual process and not something to do in bursts
  - I still have a lot to learn as a ComSci student
